            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <li>Wash and Prep the Ingredients: Rinse all the vegetables, fruits, and herbs thoroughly under cold running water. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or use a salad spinner to remove excess water. Peel and chop any necessary vegetables, such as cucumbers, carrots, and onions, into your desired shapes (e.g., slices, chunks, or grated).</li>
            <li>Tear or Cut the Lettuce: Tear or cut the lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large salad bowl. You can mix different types of lettuce for added texture and flavor.</li>
            <li>Add Vegetables and Fruits: Add the chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, and any other optional vegetables and fruits you're using to the salad bowl with the lettuce.

            </li>
            <li>Toss the Salad: Gently toss the ingredients in the bowl to mix them evenly. Use salad tongs or clean hands to combine everything without crushing the delicate vegetables.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Dressing: In a separate small bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, lemon or lime juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Optionally, you can add a spoonful of Dijon mustard and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup to balance the flavors.</li>
            <li>Dress the Salad: Pour the dressing over the salad and toss again to ensure all the ingredients are coated with the dressing.</li>
            <li>Garnish and Add Extras: Sprinkle any optional ingredients like nuts or seeds, crumbled cheese, or chopped fresh herbs over the salad for added texture and flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy: The garden salad is now ready to be served. Divide it into individual serving plates or bowls, and enjoy the refreshing and delicious combination of fresh ingredients.
